a: For example, suppose the judge wants to decide when the odds ratio is 10 to 1, then it would make the decision boundaries to be $[-\ln 10, + \ln 10]$.
[b]: For example, suppose the judge wants to decide when the odds ratio is 10 to 1, then it would set the decision boundaries to be $[-\ln 10, + \ln 10]$.

a: That is, for any $X \subset R$, we have $\psi(X)=\psi(g(X))$.
[b]: That is, for any $X \subset R$, we have $\psi(X) = \psi(g(X))$.

a: If we say that the first AGI has arrived when we have an AI that can write scientific papers that imitate a human scientist's, then we can calculate the log-perplexity loss of the first AGI.
[b]: We can think of the peer-review of scientific papers as a Turing test, and say that AGI has arrived when we have AI scientists that can pass the papers peer-review. This allows us to calculate the log-perplexity loss of the first AGI.

a: If it were a human, then it would follow 'is' with 'my cat' with probability... I do not know. However, I do know that the odds *ratio* is 2 to 1. Now the total odds ratio is 12 to 1, I can decide: $H_0$.
