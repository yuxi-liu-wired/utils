## Quotation mark errors

American style makes no sense. It was supposedly designed to avoid "hanging white spaces." However, it breaks the "substitutional equivalence," as any mathematician can tell you, a "humanist;" whereas we hold these truths to be "self-evident," that not all humanoids understand the importance of "logical consistency:" and so on...

In the next section, using the "pebble construction," they studied "Gamba perceptrons."

Then they studied "Turing jumps."

## Other punctuations

Sentence.Another sentence,without spaces...

## Common typos

*Perceptrons*, not *Perceptron*.

"multilayer perceptron", not "multilayered perceptron".

Lorenz transform, Lorentz transform, Lorentz transformation, coordinate transform, coordinate transforms, coordinate transformations.

$a_1, \dots, a_n$, not $a_1, ..., a_n$.

$$
\text{this also applies within long formulas } ...
$$

Because Rmarkdown and Quarto does not play well with the slash-bracket notation, we should avoid it. For example, the following should throw an error.

\(E = mc^2\) can be expanded into \(E = m_0c^2 + \frac 12 mv^2 + \dots\). That is,

$$
E = m_0c^2 + \frac 12 mv^2 + \dots
$$
