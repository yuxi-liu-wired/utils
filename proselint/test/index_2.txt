The Wigner Rotation in Special Relativity via Hyperbolic Geometry

Relativity, in general

The Erlangen program

In the eyes of a geometer, special relativity is not mysterious, but it
is simply another geometry that resembles our familiar Euclidean
geometry of the plane, and the spherical geometry of the earth. Just
like how Euclid compressed the geometry of the plane into around 20
axioms, we can compress the geometry of spacetime into the following
axioms:

-   Spacetime is a smooth structure, shaped like[1] the real vector
    space ℝ^(n + 1), where n is the number of spatial dimensions, and 1
    is the number of temporal dimensions.
-   Spacetime is symmetric under rotation, translation, and constant
    velocity motion.
-   There exists a fundamental speed, a “conversion factor” between the
    spatial and temporal dimensions, which we call c.
-   There are many ways to map spacetime into ℝ^(n + 1), but only some
    of them are physically meaningful. Those are called the (inertial)
    coordinate systems.
-   You can go from any one coordinate system to any other by a
    coordinate transformation.
-   Transformations can be combined one after another, and they can be
    reversed. That is, they make up a group, named the symmetry group of
    spacetime.
-   The symmetry group is smooth and connected, meaning that starting
    with the “do-nothing” identity transformation, you can combine it
    with tiny transformations, and end up at any other transformation.

Do not worry if some terms were used without a precise definition. You
can start with your best intuitive guess, and sculpt them as we go.

We will follow the spirit of Erlangen program, which states clearly what
our target is [@kleinComparativeReviewRecent1893]:

  Given a manifoldness [smooth space] and a group of transformations of
  the same; to develop theory of invariants relating to that group. This
  is the general problem, and it comprehends not alone ordinary
  geometry, but also and in particular the more recent geometrical
  theories which we propose to discuss, and the different methods of
  treating manifoldnesses of n dimensions.

Considering that Felix Klein first stated it in 1872, decades before
special relativity, this is prescient.

Applied to special relativity, our target is to start with the axioms,
find out something about what kinds of symmetries there can be, and what
kinds of objects are unchanged by symmetries. In other words, we will
study the geometry of spacetime.

Physics and mathematics

So far, while we were talking about “spacetime”, we were actually
talking about mathematical objects. There is no necessary connection
between the mathematical objects and whatever we observe in the real
world. So why do we call those mathematical objects with physically
suggestive names like “spacetime”?

Well, special relativity is really a mathematical object. It is
connected to the physical world like all objects in mathematical
physics: by experiments. Experimental data is physical, and by studying
the mathematical-object special relativity, we found that it can
generate the experimental data with a minimal amount of “glue” between
the physical world and the mathematical world. The “glue” looks like:

-   Physical events in physical spacetime are mathematical points in
    mathematical spacetime.
-   Physical light moves at the mathematical speed of c
-   Physical clocks tick at a mathematical constant rate.
-   If you move a physical clock from physical-here to physical-there,
    it is still ticking at the same mathematical constant rate.
-   …

Einstein’s The Meaning of Relativity*
[@einsteinMeaningRelativityFour1922] details physical and mathematical
correspondences, such as clock synchronization and the movement of meter
sticks.

  As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not
  certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.

Relativity in 1+1 dimensions

Making one coordinate system

To begin, let’s consider relativity in 1+1 dimensions. We will start
with a “default” coordinate system (“the rest frame”).

In the beginning was just a point in spacetime. We call this the origin,
and write its coordinates as x = 0, t = 0. The world was yet without
form. To give it form, we build a meter stick and an infinite number of
light bulbs.

We put a light bulb at the origin. Because the bulb does not “stand
still”, the light bulb traces out a path in spacetime. We call this path
the t-axis at x = 0. Because the bulb does not stand still, we cannot
properly say it is “at the origin”, but rather “passing the origin”.

  any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have
  Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural
  infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we
  incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three
  which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,
  however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former
  three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our
  consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter
  from the beginning to the end of our lives.

  —The Time Traveller, The Time Machine, Chapter 1

We put another light bulb to the left of the light bulb passing the
origin, separated by one meter stick. This light bulb traces out a line
at x = 1. And so on. Thus, we obtain an infinite number of lines:
…, x =  − 1, x = 0, x =  + 1, …. By subdividing the meter stick, we
obtain one line x = r for each real number r.

Now we have measured space, we will measure time. We remove all light
bulbs except two: one at x = 0, one at x = 1. At origin, the x = 0 light
bulb flashes, and then the light bulb at x = 1 flashes when it receives
the flash. When the light bulb at x = 0 receives the echo, this is the
echo event – and we write it down as x = 0, t = 2. Let spacetime
reverberate with shining echoes, and in this way, every point in
spacetime receives a unique coordinate (x,t).

Notice that in this construction, the fundamental speed c is equal to
one, and if we draw space and time as two perpendicular directions on a
graph-paper, then the trajectory of every light is a 45-degree straight
line on the graph-paper. These are not fundamental aspects of theory,
but are convenient outcomes given by how we constructed the coordinate
system.

Abstractly speaking, a coordinate system is a function that maps a point
in spacetime to two real numbers, like (x,t) : ℳ → ℝ¹ ⁺ ¹. Our
coordinate system constructed so far means that:

-   The origin-point p_(O) has coordinates x(p_(O)) = 0, t(p_(O)) = 0.
-   If a beam of light is traveling to the right, and passes a certain
    point p, then the set of all points on the beam of light is of form
    {q : x(q) − x(p) = t(q) − t(p)}.
-   And so on.

Such explicit distinction between the spacetime itself and the
coordinate system is uncommon in physics, and once you are used to it,
you should throw it into your subconscious like a muscle memory.
However, it is good to keep it in mind for now.

The first moving frame

The integrity of the coordinate system is based on the meter stick. If
two light bulbs are moving relative to each other, then they cannot be
always connected by a meter stick – one of them would bump into the
meter stick, or move away from it. In other words, the entire system is
static.

Now, we introduce another frame, moving at a velocity v relative to the
first. While there is no fundamental reason to privilege one over the
other, we call one the “rest frame” and the other the “moving frame” for
convenience.

The moving frame constructs its own coordinate system (x′,t′). What must
it look like?

Since the line x′ = 0 is constructed by the trajectory of the light bulb
that passes the origin, we know that the x′ = 0 line is
{p : x(p) = vt(p)}. However, when it comes to the x′ = 1 line, we have a
problem: How long should be the meter stick in the moving frame be? What
does it even mean to compare a meter stick in a moving frame with a
meter stick in the resting frame?

This difficulty is not pedantic. In the resting frame, checking that two
meter sticks are equal means taking one, accelerating it then
decelerating it, until it overlaps exactly with the other. This does not
apply if they are in relative motion.

The solution is another “gluing”. Like how we “glued” the mathematical
world with the physical world, we also glue one frame with another
frame. This is connection, a central idea in differential geometry.
However we will just do this intuitively, since in special relativity,
connections are done in the most straightforward way.

To connect two frames, we divide their difference into tiny steps, and
then do those tiny steps one after another. So, if we know how to
connect two frames when v is an infinitesimal, then we know how to
connect two arbitrary frames by taking an integral.

So for now, let v be an infinitesimal. What should be the meter stick in
the moving frame? Its meter stick is whatever is necessary so that light
speed is 1 in the moving frame. So, if we know how to tick the moving
clock, we know how to build the moving meter stick.

In the resting frame, the clock passing the origin makes a tick at every
point:

…, (0,−1), (0,0), (0,+1), …

In the moving frame, the clock passing the origin makes a tick at every
point:

…, (−v ?,−?), (0,0), (v ?,?), …

The naive choice is ? = 1. With this seemingly trivial step, we have in
fact completely defined special relativity – all else is derivation.

Why ? = 1

By the smoothness axiom, if v is infinitesimal, the coordinate
transformation between the rest frame and the moving frame should be
infinitesimally close to the identity.

Since special relativity does not distinguish left from right, if we
were to make the moving frame move at velocity  − v, then the coordinate
transformation should send (0,1) to (−δx,1+δt) by mirror symmetry.

Now, if we compose two boosts, first with v then with  − v, then we
would send (0,1) to (0,1+2δt). But we really should get back to (0,1)
since we are back to the resting frame again. Therefore δt = 0.

[Three infinitesimal boosts]

The Lorentz transformations

In the resting frame, we constructed the meter stick by shooting out one
pulse of light, then listening for the echo that arrives two ticks
later. The point at which the echo is reflected is one meter stick away.
Equivalently, we can shoot a forward-pointing light cone at (0,−1), and
shoot a backward-pointing light cone at (0,+1). Their intersections are
the two ends of two meter sticks: (−1,0), (+1,0).

In the boosted frame, the clock passing the origin ticks at
…, (−v,−1), (0,0), (v,1), …. Therefore, we can construct its meter stick
in the same way, and we would find that the two light cones intersect at
(−1,−v), (+1,+v). This gives us the coordinate transformation:

$$\forall p \in \mathcal{M}, \quad 
\begin{bmatrix} x(p) \\ t(p) \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & v \\ v & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x'(p) \\ t'(p) \end{bmatrix}
$$

Here, we find that we need to distinguish between “active” and “passive”
transformations. Everything we have said so far is “passive”. We assume
that there is an underlying spacetime ℳ, and we are to construct
coordinate systems over it. The coordinate transformation tells us how
to turn the coordinates of the same point from one coordinate system to
another. However, while this is often useful, it would make everything
we are going to say next very awkward.

Therefore, we immediately change our point of view: we are going to
study “active” transformations from now on. While passive transformation
of a clock means that we have just one clock and measure its ticks in
two coordinate systems, active transformation of a clock means that we
actually pick up the clock at rest frame, accelerate it on a rocket, and
then let it glide at constant velocity at the moving frame, then study
what the clock is doing in the rest frame.

Since an active transformation is the opposite of a passive transform,
we have the active Lorentz transformation formula:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ t' \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & v \\ v & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ t \end{bmatrix}
 \qquad(1)$$

This formula states that if we “pick up” the spacetime event at (x,t) in
the rest frame, and accelerate it infinitesimally to speed v, then the
spacetime event ends up at (x′,t′) in the rest frame.

Integrating the Lorentz boosts

Since v is infinitesimal, to find the Lorentz transformation for a
non-infinitesimal v (say, v = 10⁻¹⁰⁰, which, while small, is really big
for an infinitesimal), we need to integrate over it.

Before we do so, we should play with the discrete version: what happens
if we repeatedly apply the matrix
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & v \\ v & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ on the vectors
(0,1), (1,0)?

In the diagram, v is “rapidity”[2]. We apply the Lorentz boost with the
given v repeatedly forwards and backwards. The resulting image is
beautiful and suggestive: it looks like the unit hyperbolas!

Having guessed the answer, we proceed with the explicit integral to
confirm our guess.

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & dv \\ dv & 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\frac{v}{dv}} &= \left(I + \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\right)^{\frac{v}{dv}}\\
  &= \exp\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} v\right) \\
  &= I + \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} v + \frac{1}{2!}v^2\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}^2 + \frac{1}{3!}v^3\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}^3 + \cdots \\
  &= I(1 + v^2/2! + v^4/4! + \cdots) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}(v + v^3/3! + v^5/5! + \cdots) \\
  &= I\cosh(v) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \sinh(v)
  \end{aligned}
 \qquad(2)$$

At this point, we should pause to take a careful look at v. While it is
the same as velocity when v is infinitesimal, it is not the same as
velocity otherwise, because velocity is bounded between  − 1 and  + 1,
whereas this v quantity is free to vary over all real values. This is
why we call it “rapidity” and relabel it as w, since it is like
velocity, but different.

The velocity v for a given rapidity w is determined by transforming the
t-axis using the Lorentz transformation matrix
$\begin{bmatrix} \cosh(w) & \sinh(w) \\ \sinh(w) & \cosh(w) \end{bmatrix}$.
The t-axis
{(0,s) : s ∈ ℝ}
is boosted to the line
{(sinh(w)s,cosh(w)s) : s ∈ ℝ}
Therefore, the velocity of this boosted frame is
w = sinh (w)/cosh (w) = tanh (w).

Now you can play with the diagram below to grow a new intuitive sense of
how it all ties together. After you have grown this new intuition, you
can proceed.

A “spacetime square” would transform like:

3-velocity, 4-velocity, and inner product in spacetime

In the diagram above, we have used the terms 3-velocity and 4-velocity.
To explain those terms, we briefly go back to 3+1 dimensions.

When we say “velocity” informally, we mean a vector in ℝ³. But how is
velocity really defined? It is displacement divided by time. In
relativity, when we say “3-velocity”, there are two possible
representations: we can represent it as (v_(x),v_(y),v_(z)), or we can
represent it as (v_(x),v_(y),v_(z),1). The first is close to how the
rest of the world use “velocity”, but the second is close to how special
relativity want us to use the word “velocity”. The second representation
can be interpreted as follows: “The 3-velocity of an object is the
spacetime displacement of the object after one tick of my clock.”

Neither is satisfactory, however, because 3-velocity behaves badly under
Lorentz transformations. The first representation (v_(x),v_(y),v_(z))
does not have the time-coordinate, so it can’t even be multiplied with
the Lorentz transformation matrix. The second representation
(v_(x),v_(y),v_(z),1) would, after a Lorentz transformation, have its
time-coordinate  ≠ 1.

Both problems are elegantly resolved if we use the 4-velocity, which
means we have to divide 3-velocity by its norm… but what norm? Why,
think back to the Erlangen program:

  Given a manifoldness [smooth space] and a group of transformations of
  the same; to develop theory of invariants relating to that group.

In plane geometry, we know that although x, y, x′, y′ are geometrically
meaningless, the norm-squared (x−x′)² + (y−y′)² is meaningful, because
that quantity is not changed (invariant) if you apply the rotation
matrix
$\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$
to it. What would be an invariant for spacetime?

Looking at the picture of the Lorentz transformation in 1+1 dimensions,
we can see that the intersection of the two light cones appears to have
a constant area. In particular, the upper rectangle has constant area.
That is, the quantity (x−t)(x+t) is preserved.

Thus we define the Minkowski norm-squared: ∥(x,t)∥² := x² − t². Note
that this is not an actual square because it can be negative. However it
is preserved under Lorentz transformations.

Once we have a norm-squared, we can extend it to an inner product::

$$\braket{v, w} := \frac{\|v+w\|^2 - \|v-w\|^2}{4} = v_x w_x - v_t w_t$$

which is still an invariant under Lorentz transformations, and thus
physically meaningful. This extends in general to n+1 dimensions. For
example, in 3+1 dimensions, the inner product is
∑_(i = x, y, z)v_(i)w_(i) − v_(t)w_(t).

With this, the 4-velocity is at hand! We just need to normalize
(v_(x),v_(y),v_(z),1), taking care to remove the negative sign:

$$
(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)/\sqrt{-\|(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)\|^2} = \frac{(v_x, v_y, v_z, 1)}{\sqrt{1-(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}}
$$

As an example of the power of this geometric algebra, we rederive the
Lorentz transformation with infinitesimal boost. In the rest frame, the
unit clock-tick is the vector (0,1), and the two unit meter sticks are
the vectors (−1,0), (1,0). They are uniquely defined by the two
geometric properties:

$$
\braket{s, (0, 1)} = 0; \braket{s, s} = 1
$$

Therefore, in the boosted frame, the boosted meter sticks are the two
solutions to

$$
\braket{s', (v, 1)} = 0; \braket{s', s'} = 1
$$

which are s′ = (−1,v), (1,v). By continuity, (1,0) cannot have been
boosted to (−1,v), so it must be boosted to (1,v). This gives us
Equation 1.

Relativity in 2+1 dimensions

Infinitesimal Lorentz transformations

In 1+1 dimensions, we have only two spatial directions: left and right.
In 2+1 dimensions, there is a whole circle of directions. We call this
circle the “space circle”, because the alternative name “hula hoop for
spacetime” sounds too silly.

Just like in 1+1 dimensions, the space circle is constructed by shooting
a forward light cone at (0,0,−1) and a backward light cone at (0,0,+1).
Their intersection is the space circle. A space circle plus a ticking
clock together allows us to define a coordinate system with three unit
vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Both the clock and the space circle
can be boosted. We will pick the simplest possible way to transport the
ticking clock and the space circle, and experiments with Thomas
precession would show that this is the right way.

Suppose we perform an infinitesimal boost by (v_(x),0), then, by the
same picture as in the 1+1 dimension case, we know that the clock-tick
(0,0,1) is boosted to (v_(x),0,1), and the space circle is boosted to
the ellipse with long semiaxis (1,0,v_(x)) and short semiaxis (0,1,0).
Where should each point on the space circle go to? Since the space
circle is rigid, if we know where one point must go to, we know where
all points must go to.

The semiaxis (0,1,0) is both on the original space circle and the
boosted space circle. It stands to reason that the simplest pick would
preserve it after the infinitesimal boost. That is, we should not
“twist” the space circle under boosting. With this choice, we are forced
to pick (1,0,v_(x)) as the boosted (1,0,0), since it is the unique unit
vector that is perpendicular to (0,1,0), (v_(x),0,1), and
infinitesimally close to (1,0,0).

Alternatively, we can think of Lorentz transformation in 2+1 dimensions
as the same with Lorentz transformation in 1+1 dimensions, but with an
extra dimension. Therefore, we can minimally modify Equation 1 to:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ t' \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ v_x & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ t \end{bmatrix}
$$

the same result as our previous argument.

This extends to the case of an infinitesimal boost (v_(x),v_(y)):

$$
\begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \\ t' \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\ 0 & 1 & v_y \\ v_x & v_y & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ t \end{bmatrix}
 \qquad(3)$$

  Four ways to derive it

  1.  Just guess it.
  2.  Rotate the coordinate system so that the boost is in the
      x-direction, boost using the previous result, then rotate the
      coordinate system back. To be pedantic: We are performing one
      passive, then one active, then one passive transformation.
  3.  Take the previous derivation, and modify it by strategically
      inserting v_(y) at places.
  4.  Since two infinitesimal boosts do not interact except at the
      second-order infinitesimal level, and O(v²) ≪ O(v) ≪ 1, we are
      free to discard the second-order infinitesimal. Therefore, we can
      just multiply the two matrices together to get the full thing:

  $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ v_x & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & v_y \\ 0 & v_y & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & v_x \\ 0 & 1 & v_y \\ v_x & v_y & 1 \end{bmatrix} + O(v^2)$$

Fermi–Walker transport

Equation 3 is correct, but it is still not geometric. We must convert it
with only quantities that are invariant under Lorentz transformations –
that is, the inner product.

Denote the 4-velocity vector (0,0,1) by the letter u, and the
infinitesimal boost (v_(x),v_(y),0) by δu. Then, an arbitrary vector e
is boosted to e + δe, Where

$$
\delta e = 
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & v_x \\ 0 & 0 & v_y \\ v_x & v_y & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} e_x \\ e_y \\ e_t \end{bmatrix} = e_t (v_x, v_y, 0) + (e_x v_x + e_y v_y) (0, 0, 1)
$$

This gives us the Fermi–Walker transport equation:

$$
\delta e = - \braket{e, u} \delta u + \braket{e, \delta u}u 
 \qquad(4)$$

If you want a more amusing mental image, here it is: Consider a
spaceship that looks like a spherical ~~cow~~ porcupine in a vacuum.
Every porcupine spine is a rocket engine. The spaceship can boost in any
direction, but it does not rotate. Thanks to Wigner rotation, it can
rotate anyway. Now, the spaceship is performing some complicated
manuever in spacetime. If we allow it to carry around a general vector
pointing in an arbitrary direction e, the question becomes: as the
vector is boosted alongside the spaceship, how does the vector change?

Consider a problem in general relativity, where we have a vector field
over spacetime, and an accelerating observer. To calculate how quickly
the vector field is changing relative to the observer, we must account
for:

-   acceleration of the observer, using the Fermi–Walker transport
    equation;
-   the curvature of spacetime itself, so that comparing one vector with
    another requires us to perform parallel transport in spacetime (with
    the “covariant derivative”).

General Lorentz transformations

The Lorentz transformation in 2+1 dimensions can be derived similarly to
how Equation 2 was derived. Let the rapidity vector w⃗ be equal to
w(n_(x),n_(y)), where (n_(x),n_(y)) is a unit vector (the direction of
rapidity). Then the Lorentz transformation is found by performing
another matrix exponentiation:

$$\exp\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & n_x \\ 0 & 0 & n_y \\ n_x & n_y & 0 \end{bmatrix} w\right)$$

To be more succinct, we define the matrices

$$K_x := \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad K_y := \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

then the Lorentz transformation is just e^(w⃗ ⋅ K⃗) = e^(wn⃗ ⋅ K⃗).

Now, since (n⃗⋅K⃗)³ = n⃗ ⋅ K⃗, we have the Lorentz transformation equation

I + sinh (w)n⃗ ⋅ K⃗ + (cosh(w)−1)(n⃗⋅K⃗)²   (5)

This equation extends naturally to relativity in n+1 dimensions, but we
will not need it.

  Deriving (n⃗⋅K⃗)³ = n⃗ ⋅ K⃗

  Let t stand for the index of the time-coordinate, and let i, j, k be
  the indices of the space-coordinates. Then we have
  (n⃗⋅K⃗)³ = n_(i)n_(j)n_(k)(e_(it)+e_(ti))(e_(jt)+e_(tj))(e_(kt)+e_(tk))

  where e_(mn) means the matrix with entry (m,n) being one and all other
  entries being zero. We use Einstein summation convention, so repeated
  indices means summing over it (except t, which is not an index to sum
  over).

  Since e_(mn)e_(kl) = δ_(nk)e_(ml), and i ≠ t, j ≠ t, k ≠ t, the above
  multiplication expands to 8 terms, but only two are nonzero:

  $$= n_in_jn_k(e_{it}\delta_{jk} + \delta_{ij} e_{tk}) = \underbrace{\|\vec{n}\|^2}_{= 1} (n_i e_{it} + n_k e_{tk}) = n_i (e_{it} + e_{ti}) = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{K}$$

Wigner rotation

We are ready to derive a rarely discussed effect in special relativity:
the Wigner rotation. Although it is as fundamental as time dilation and
space contraction, it often goes unmentioned in undergraduate textbooks
I have encountered.

Theorem 1 (Wigner rotation) When three boosts are made in a cycle, such
as p₁ → p₂ → p₃ → p₁, the result is a rotation. The angle of rotation is
equal to the hyperbolic area of the triangle p₁p₂p₃, but in the opposite
direction. Furthermore, the hyperbolic area is equal to the angle defect
of the triangle.

The phrase “in the opposite direction” means that, if, looking from the
 + t-direction down at the origin, you see the three 3-velocities make a
counterclockwise cycle in the disk
{(v_(x),v_(y),1) : v_(x)² + v_(y)² = 1}, then you would see that the
Wigner rotation angle is in the clockwise direction, and vice versa. The
phrase “angle defect” means π − (∠p₁p₂p₃+∠p₂p₃p₁+∠p₃p₁p₂).

Step-by-step demonstration of the Wigner rotation

Consider the simplest type of three-boost cycle as shown in the figure
below. We start at the rest frame, boost to the frame with a 3-velocity
of ((v_x, 0)), then boost to the frame with a 3-velocity of ((v_x, v_x
d)), and finally boost back to the rest frame.

Tracing out the trajectory of every point on the space circle gives the
following sequence:

| []                   | []                   | []                   |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

When projected to the xy-plane, the sequence looks like:

Therefore, after three pure boosts, we end up with a rotation by (γ−1)dφ
radians in the opposite direction. Here, γ is the long semiradius of the
boosted space circle, after projecting it down to the xy plane. This is
the “Lorentz factor” often used in special relativity:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}$$

  Deriving the Lorentz factor

  In the rest frame, the space circle is spanned by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0).
  After boosting by the 3-velocity (v,0), it is boosted to an ellipse
  with semiaxes (cosh(w),0,sinh(w)), (0,1,0), where $w = \arctanh(v)$ is
  its rapidity. Thus, its projection to the xy plane is an ellipse with
  semiaxes (cosh(w),0), (0,1).

  $$\gamma = \cosh(w) = \cosh(\arctanh(v)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}$$

Performing boosts around a full cycle of 3-velocities and returning to
our starting 3-velocity is equivalent to performing an infinite number
of infinitesimal triangle-circuit boosts:

Therefore, a full cycle of boosts rotates our space circle by a full
(γ−1)2π radians in the opposite direction.

Interactive app for the Wigner rotation

With this understanding, you can now fully appreciate the following
interactive app demonstrating the Wigner rotation.

The left picture represents the xy plane, and the right picture
represents the xyt spacetime.

You can drag the black dot on the left, which represents the 3-velocity.
The 3-velocity is restricted to have maximal norm 0.8, to keep the app
numerically stable. The blue ellipse is the projection of the space
circle to the xy plane. A fixed point on the space circle is
distinguished by a big red dot, so that you can see how the space circle
Wigner-rotates as you drag the 3-velocity around.

In the right picture, the forward and backward light cones intersect at
the space circle. You can drag and scroll to adjust the camera.

Here is a “tourist’s guide to the visualization”.

The three boosts in animated form:

Because $\gamma - 1 = \frac{2}{3}$, if you drag the 3-velocity for 3
full cycles at maximal velocity, the space circle would complete -2 full
cycles.

Suppose a particle is moving close to the speed of light and emitting
photons at equal angular density in all directions in its own frame,
then in the rest frame the photons are bunched in front of the particle.
This is the relativistic beaming effect, or the headlight effect.

Thomas precession

The Wigner rotation formula is equivalent to the following formula,
often called the Thomas precession formula:

$$
\vec{\omega} = \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma + 1} \vec{a} \times \vec{v}
 \qquad(6)$$

Experiments with particles moving in cyclotrons have verified this, thus
justifying our guess that we should transport space circles without
twisting.

  Deriving the Thomas precession formula

  Consider a particle moving counterclockwise at a constant speed v in a
  circle of radius R. Its acceleration is a = v²/R, and after completing
  one cycle in time T = 2πR/v, it has Wigner-rotated by  − (γ−1)2π
  radians. Simplifying, we have

  $$\omega = \frac{-(\gamma - 1)2\pi}{T} = \cdots = -\frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma + 1} av$$

  By the right hand rule of cross products, we can get all the
  directions correct with
  $\vec{\omega} = \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma + 1} \vec{a} \times \vec{v}$.

  For a particle undergoing a generic acceleration, the 3-acceleration
  decomposes into a component parallel to the 3-velocity, and a
  component perpendicular to it. The parallel component does not change
  Wigner rotation, therefore the Thomas precession equation is still
  true.

However, notice that the formula is made of 3-vectors, and we know that
3-vectors are meaningless in special relativity. This suggests that
something is off here. If the rest of this section does not make much
sense, first read the section on Foucault pendulum, then return here.

If the Earth were flat, then we could stand at a single point, and draw
two perpendicular arrows. We say, “this arrow is pointing at  + x”, and
“that arrow is pointing at  + y”. Then we create an infinite number of
missionaries. Each would pick up the two arrows and parallel-transport
the arrows to their given station on the Earth. In this way, we would
provide a unique direction-system for every point on the Earth.

However, because the Earth is a sphere, this does not work. Suppose we
stand at the North Pole, and we do the same. Then all the missionaries
would meet at the South Pole and start arguing about who has the right
one, because they would all disagree. This problem happens because the
Earth is curved, and transporting a vector around a cycle would rotate
it.

We might shrug and say, “Well, nobody lives in the South Pole, so we
will just tell our missionaries to avoid it.”. Great idea, except then
they found that Emperor of China has also sent out his own missionaries.
We shrug and say, “Well, we’ll just give the Emperor of China a call and
ask him what angle he picked. Then we will rotate our map until all our
missionaries agreed with his.”. After some fruitless fiddling with our
maps, it has dawned to us that this plan is doomed. Why?

Imagine if the North Pole is at point N, and the Emperor of China is at
point C. If somehow, we could pick our xy directions so that all our
missionaries agree with his, then we can send one missionary around a
three-part journey around the world: N → C → K → N, where K is a point
off the great circle passing N, C. Along the path N → C, the missionary
is leaving the North Pole on a straight arc away from the North Pole, so
the xy chart he is carrying agrees with the missionaries he is passing
by. Similarly for the other two parts. But when the missionary has
returned to the North Pole, he must find his xy chart rotated,
contradiction!

There is no way to resolve this disagreement other than forcing one side
to give up their coordinate system. Perhaps we will have to call up a
crusade to enforce our coordinate system.

  The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence.

  —Hermann Weyl

Similarly, in special relativity, we can stand at the “North Pole” (rest
frame), construct the xyz axes, then send out missionaries on rockets to
provide directions for every inertial frame. The good news is that no
two missionaries can meet each other, so there is no argument. The bad
news is that we still have the Wigner rotation problem, so if some
aliens are executing the same project, but starting at a different
coordinate frame (perhaps because their galaxy is moving relative to
ours), then it is impossible for our missionaries to agree in every
frame.

So, we are forced to only use one rest frame. It is in this context that
the Thomas precession formula works.

Consider an object, boosted from frame p₁ to frame p₂, with their
3-velocities in the rest frame being v⃗ and v⃗ + δv⃗. To use the Thomas
precession formula, we must first – in imagination – boost it back to
the rest frame, and take a snapshot of its orientation against our xyz
axes at origin. Then we boost it back to frame p₁, boost it to p₂, and
boost it – in imagination – back to the rest frame again. By using the
Wigner rotation formula in the rest frame, it has rotated by

$$
\frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma + 1} \delta\vec{v} \times \vec{v}
$$

To emphasize again: the Thomas precession formula only works in one
frame. It is neither Lorentz invariant nor geometrically meaningful. It
cannot be geometrically meaningful, because it is made of 3-vectors
v⃗, a⃗, ω⃗, and 3-vectors are geometrically meaningless in special
relativity.[3]

Relativity in 3+1 dimensions

We began our study of special relativity in 1+1 dimensions and
discovered the Lorentz transformations, then proceeded to 2+1 dimensions
and discovered Wigner rotation. In 3+1 dimensions, Wigner rotation still
occurs, but there is something new: rotations are no longer describable
by a single number.

This is not a place to get into the details; suffice to say that the
space of rotations in ℝ³ is much harder to understand than the space of
rotations in ℝ².[4] We must be more careful here.

Suppose we have four frames: 0, 1, 2, 3. We start with a tripod in frame
0, then boost it successively to frames 1, 2, 3, and0, how much does it
rotate? To discover this, we need to compose the Wigner rotation around
the cycle 0120 with the Wigner rotation around the cycle 0230. The full
rotation is composed of two rotations, first rotation in the plane of
the triangle 012, and the second one in the plane of the triangle 023.

The Wigner rotation coming from an arbitrary sequence of boosts can be
calculated easily with the Thomas precession formula, if we are willing
to use violence.[5] Without violence, we have to do spherical
trigonometry, much harder than adding 2-dimensional rotation angles. My
intuition is that it should most naturally involve the principal
G-connections, where G = SO(n,1) is the group of Lorentz
transformations.

Velocity space is hyperbolic geometry

It is time to fulfill the promise in the title, that hyperbolic geometry
is involved.

Our first hint that hyperbolic geometry is relevant is that we have
encountered cosh  and sinh  – the hyperbolic trigonometric functions.
With this hint, a quick check shows us that we are indeed dealing with
hyperbolic geometry. This is easy to do in 2+1 dimensions, but it
generalizes readily to n+1 dimensions after slightly cluttering the
notation.

Deriving the hyperbolic metric

Since ∥(0,0,1)∥² =  − 1, under arbitrary Lorentz transformations,
(0,0,1) can, under arbitrary Lorentz transformations, reach any point on
the upper half of the hyperbola x² + y² − t² =  − 1. It stands to reason
that the upper hyperbola, which is equivalent to a plane as a smooth
manifold, should have some kind of planar geometry. We need only
discover its metric. The most direct path goes through the disk of
3-velocities, which gives us the metric

$$
ds^2 = \frac{dv_\theta^2}{1-v_r^2} + \frac{dv_r^2}{(1-v_r^2)^2}
 \qquad(7)$$

  Deriving the metric of the 3-velocity disk

  The disk of 3-velocities {(v_(x),v_(y),1) : v_(x)² + v_(y)² < 1} is
  not preserved under Lorentz transformations, but we can project it
  back to the circular disk. This means that we can take the metric at
  origin

  ds² = dv_(x)^(y) + dv_(y)²

  and perform a Lorentz transformation, followed by a projection, to
  move the origin to any other point on the disk. Multiplying the metric
  at the origin with the gradient-matrix gives the metric at that other
  point.

  We exploit the rotational symmetry of the disk using polar
  coordinates. Express any point on the disk as (r,θ). Its local metric
  must be of form ds² = f(r)dr² + g(r)dθ² + h(r)drdθ for some functions
  f, g, h. Further, by reflection symmetry of θ ↔  − θ, we have
  h(r) = 0.

  To find f(r), we construct an infinitesimal segment (r,0) → (r+dr,0)
  and calculate with the velocity-addition formula. Similarly, we find
  g(r) using the segment (r,0) → (r,dθ).

This is the Beltrami–Klein metric, and so we have discovered that this
is exactly the Beltrami–Klein model of hyperbolic geometry. We can then
project this metric onto the hyperboloid x² + y² − t² =  − 1 to obtain
its metric

ds² = dx² + dy² − dt² = ∥(dx,dy,dt)∥²   (8)

This, in hindsight, is obvious: We have already known that the Lorentz
transformation preserves the Minkowski norm-squared. But such is the
journey of discovery: the first pass is rarely the most elegant. It is
probably better to write down the first pass to show how to discover
things, then write a second pass to show how to tidy things. Better this
than what Gauss did:

  [Gauss] makes his mathematics like a fox, wiping out the traces in the
  sand with his tail.

  —unnamed German student, as reported by Abel

Interpreting the hyperbolic geometry

Now we can connect concepts between hyperbolic geometry and special
relativity.

When v is small, the Wigner rotation for a full cycle, (γ−1)2π, is
πv² + O(v⁴), coinciding with the area enclosed by the cycle.Therefore,
since both area and Wigner rotation are additive, we have proven
Theorem 1.[6]

In rocketry, if we trace out the trajectory of the rocket’s velocity on
a graph paper, we obtain a hodograph. Similarly, in relativistic
rocketry, a path in the velocity space is a hodograph. The length of a
hodograph is the total delta-v of the rocket.

A straight line in hyperbolic space is the hodograph of the most
fuel-efficient control-trajectory for a rocket to get from one velocity
to another.

If a rocket explodes with spherical symmetry, the velocities of its
debris will lie on a hyperbolic sphere centered at the rocket’s original
velocity.

Two parables

The star worshippers

An alien race, who worshipped Rigel, Deneb, and Betelgeuse, prayed in
the direction of these three stars. In order to pray in the correct
direction even without seeing them, they constructed the Sacred Tripods,
which are steel tripods that are oriented such that each leg points at
one of the Sacred Stars. These Sacred Tripods, placed in public spaces,
were required to point precisely at the Sacred Stars.

Then a Cosmic Dark Age began and the stars winked out of existence,
including the Sacred Stars, but the aliens did not lose their faith.
Instead, they intensified their prayers in hopes of resurrecting the
Sacred Stars.

In a region of space, there were two space stations A and B, at rest
with each other. The Sacred Tripod on B was unstable, and required
yearly calibration against the more stable Sacred Tripod at A. So
station A would align its spare Sacred Tripod to its own one, put it on
a gimbal-mount, and send it by rocket to station B. B would align its
Tripod with the one sent, then let the Tripod go back.

As years passed, the aliens on station B grew confident that their
Tripod did not drift more than 1″ per year. One day, an asteroid field
blocked the straight path, forcing the next shipment to make a big
detour around the asteroid field. When it arrived, to their
astonishment, it was found that the Tripod on B was clearly misaligned
with the Tripod from A. What could be the cause of this misalignment?

The day the Earth stood still

One day, the Earth stopped spinning. This annoyed the visitors to the
science museum, who wanted to see Foucault’s pendulum rotating. To
satisfy those visitors, the museum keeper put the pendulum on the top of
a bus, and loaded the visitors on the bus, then they started driving
around the Earth at the same speed as how the Earth used to rotate at
that latitude, so that after one day, they returned to the museum. The
visitors looked up at the pendulum and were satisfied to see that it
indeed has turned.

To find out how much the pendulum has turned, we divide up the circular
trajectory into tiny segments p₀, p₁, …, p_(n), then draw tiny triangles
p₀p₁N, p₁p₂N, …, p_(n − 1)p_(n)N, with N being the North Pole. We
imagine that, instead of driving around the Earth in a circle, we drive
around the triangle N → p₀ → p₁ → N, then the triangle N → p₁ → p₂ → N,
etc.

When we drive around N → p₀ → p₁ → N, the bus makes three turns, and
each time the pendulum turns by an opposite amount relative to the bus.
After three turns, the bus has turned the same angle as the sum of three
external angles of the triangle. By spherical trigonometry, we know that
this is equal to
$2\pi - 4\pi\frac{\text{area of triangle $p_0 p_1 N$}}{\text{surface area of the Earth}}$.
Thus, the pendulum has turned relative to the bus by
$-2\pi + 4\pi\frac{\text{area of triangle $p_0 p_1 N$}}{\text{surface area of the Earth}}$.
The  − 2π part has no effect, as it is a full cycle, leaving us with
$\frac{\text{area of triangle $p_0 p_1 N$}}{\text{surface area of the Earth}}$.

Therefore, by adding them up, we find that after driving around an
arbitrary cycle on the Earth, the pendulum would have turned by

$$4\pi\frac{\text{area of the cycle}}{\text{surface area of the Earth}}$$

We can turn this insight into a formula for Fermi–Walker transport on
the Earth.

First, we scale the Earth so that its radius is one. Now set up the
coordinate system ϕ, θ, where ϕ is the latitude (zero at equator, π/2 at
the North Pole) and θ the longitude. At each point on the Earth (except
the two poles) we set up a local frame with two unit vectors ϕ̂, θ̂. One
very important fact is that this local frame is not
parallel-transported[7]. If you try to drive in a small circle around
the North Pole, while always pointing in the direction of θ̂, you would
feel a strong centrifugal force pushing against your steering wheel.
Centrifugal forces and all other “inertial forces” are nature’s way of
telling you that you are not being parallel-transported.

Consider two infinitesimally close points on the Earth, p₁ = (ϕ,θ) and
p₂ = (ϕ+δϕ,θ+δϕ). Since the surface area of a spherical cap around
latitude θ is $\frac{1 -\sin\theta}{2}$ that of the whole sphere[8], the
area of a thin spherical triangle with vertices p₁, p₂, N is

$$4\pi\frac{1 -\sin\theta}{2} \times \frac{\delta\phi}{2\pi} = (1-\sin\theta)\delta\phi$$

Thus, if we parallel transport a vector clockwise in the order
p₁ → N → p₂ → p₁, then the vector would turn counterclockwise by
 − (1−sinθ)δϕ.

Now, consider two ways to move the pendulum from p₁ to p₂. We can
transport it directly, or detour through the North Pole. If we detour
through the North Pole like p₁ → N → p₂, then by the same argument as
the “polar bear puzzle”[9], you see that the pendulum has rotated
counterclockwise relative to the local frame by  − δϕ. Then we complete
its journey with p₂ → p₁, to create an absolute[10] full  − (1−sinθ)δϕ
rotation. Therefore, moving it p₂ → p₁ has created a rotation relative
to the local frame by sin θδϕ. Since we are actually moving it p₁ → p₂,
we reverse the sign, and obtain our Fermi–Walker transport equation (the
Earthbound version):

δ(vector angle) =  − sin θδϕ   (9)

Applied to the Foucault pendulum problem, we find that it rotates
clockwise by 2πsin θ every day, and it takes $\frac{1}{\sin\theta}$
days[11] to make a full rotation. At the Paris Observatory, the original
place where Foucault made his experiment in 1851, we have

$$\theta = \mathrm{48^\circ 52' N}, \quad \text{period} = \frac{\mathrm{23h56'}}{\sin \theta} \approx \mathrm{31\,h\,50\,min}$$

If a museum visitor can stay for 5 minutes at the pendulum, then they
would see the pendulum complete  ≈ 1/382 of a cycle. Typical museums
would put up about 400 wooden blocks in a cycle, to be knocked down by
the pendulum. This allows each visitor to see at least one block being
knocked down.

Pedagogical attempts to present the Foucault pendulum and the Wigner
rotation have been numerous, such as
[@criadoThomasRotationFoucault2009], but perhaps due to the decade-long
latency in academic publishing, none has yet made it into the usual
undergrad textbooks. Tevian Dray has written an entire textbook
[@drayGeometrySpecialRelativity2021] treating both special and general
relativity in the same geometric style. For a summary paper of the
textbook, see [@drayGeometryRelativity2017].

Amusing quotes from [@walterNonEuclideanStyleMinkowskian1999]

  [After 1907] Minkowski never again referred to a manifold as both
  four-dimensional and non-Euclidean. Along with the problematic label,
  the geometric interpretation of velocity vectors likewise vanishes
  from view in Minkowski’s subsequent writings. Felix Klein, for one,
  regretted the change; in his opinion, Minkowski later hid from view
  his “innermost mathematical, especially invariant-theoretical
  thoughts” on theory of relativity (Klein 1927, 75).

  Planck lavished praise on Einstein for his modification of the concept
  of time:

    It need scarcely be emphasized that this new view of the concept of
    time makes the most serious demands upon the capacity of abstraction
    and the imaginative power of the physicist. It surpasses in boldness
    everything achieved so far in speculative investigations of nature,
    and even in philosophical theories of knowledge: nonEuclidean
    geometry is child’s play in comparison.30 (Planck 1910a, 117)

  Under the new space-time view, Minkowski announced, “Three-dimensional
  geometry becomes a chapter of four-dimensional physics.” In the same
  triumphant spirit, Minkowski suggested that his new four-dimensional
  understanding of the laws of physics deserved its own label. The
  “Principle of the Hyperbolic World” that he had tried on Hurwitz was
  shelved in favor of the more ecumenical “Postulate of the Absolute
  World” (Minkowski 1909, 82). Although Minkowski explained this to mean
  that only the four-dimensional world in space and time is given by
  phenomena (Minkowski 1909, 82), one suspects an inside joke with
  Hurwitz, since in the German mathematical community, hyperbolic
  geometry was sometimes referred to as absolute geometry.

  Even the watered-down version of the space-time theory presented in
  Minkowski’s Cologne lecture repelled some physicists. For instance,
  Willy Wien’s cousin Max (1866-1938), a physicist at Danzig
  Polytechnic, confided to his friend Arnold Sommerfeld that reading
  Minkowski gave him vertigo:

    Sommer[feld] maintains that [Minkowski’s] speech in Cologne was
    simply grand; when reading it, however, I always get a slight
    brain-shiver, now (that) space and time appear conglomerated
    together in a gray, miserable chaos.36 (Max Wien to Arnold
    Sommerfeld, February 16, 1909, Benz 1975, 71)

The history of this document

During high school, I was in the physics Olympiad team. One afternoon, I
got into an argument with someone about what happens if you take a
square [0,1] × [0,1], boost it by (v,0), and then boost it by (0,v′)
within the boosted frame. By the velocity addition formula, the square
would move at 3-velocity

$$
(v, \frac{v'\sqrt{1-v^2}}{1+vv'})
$$

If $v' = \frac{v}{\sqrt{1-v^2}-v^2}$, then the square would be moving at
(v,v).

Then, the paradox. He argued that, by length contraction along the
diagonal, the square should look like a diamond:

I objected that in the boosted frame, the square looks like a rectangle
moving upwards. Decompose the rectangle into a bundle of line-segments,
all parallel to the y′-axis. Now, each line-segment is moving in the
y′-direction, and y′ is parallel to y (since the perpendicular direction
is preserved under boosting), we know that each moving line-segment
would still be a line-segment parallel to the y-axis in the resting
frame, still moving in the y-direction – just slower. Therefore, in the
resting frame, the whole square would look like a parallelogram, with
two sides parallel to the y-axis, and the other two sides oblique to the
x-axis.

After a brief shouting match, we figured out that I was right, but also
that we met something no teacher has taught us before: you can create a
rotation in special relativity by pure boosting.

During my third undergraduate year, I took a course in theoretical
physics, which required a term paper. I first tried to write one on the
Ostrogradsky instability, but could not understand it, so I quickly
switched to finally solving the rotation effect in special relativity.

Suffice to say that, after some hours walking and staring at the night
sky, I figured out that it is nothing else than hyperbolic geometry, and
nothing more paradoxical than the fact that the external angle of a
hyperbolic triangle is equal to 2π + (area of the triangle), which I
remember from hyperbolic geometry.

This is the old poler-bear puzzle again. If you walk from the North Pole
to the equator, then walk (1/4) of the way around the Earth, and finally
walk back to the North Pole, you will have traversed a triangle with an
external angle of ( ). In general, the external angle of a triangle on
the unit sphere is 2π − (area of the triangle), the perfect opposite to
the case in hyperbolic geometry.

Half-mad, I ran home and smashed into the search engine all the keywords
I knew must be there: “special relativity rotation hyperbolic triangle
Foucault pendulum”. My disappointment was swift and certain: This had
been repeatedly discovered over the past hundred years.

Bitterly, I searched every undergraduate physics textbook in the school
library. None included it. The standard textbook
[@goldsteinClassicalMechanics2008, Section 7.3] went on a three-page
long computation and concluded that, indeed, we obtain a rotation
matrix:

  The spatial rotation resulting from the successive application of two
  nonparallel Lorentz transformations has been declared every bit as
  paradoxical as the more frequently discussed apparent violations of
  common sense, such as the so-calIed “twin paradox”. But the present
  apparent paradox has important applications, especially in atomic
  physics, and therefore has been abundantly verified experimentally.

From that moment on I swore that I would finally present it in a way so
simple and direct that it will never be forgotten. I had found the way,
and it remained to publicize to the world.

There was little use in writing another paper about it, as despite the
many papers over the century, somehow this effect did not end up in the
physics textbooks. I considered writing a blog post about it, but mere
words and figures seemed insufficient. I tried promoting this idea to
various physics popularizers on YouTube, but none picked it up. What I
needed was interactive animation, but JavaScript defeated me, so I kept
it in the backlog until now. With ChatGPT I could finally write
JavaScript without losing all my sanity, and so, here it is.

Some bonus content

Finding the Wigner rotation in one line

If you know Lie algebra, then the Wigner rotation is immediate:
calculate the commutator.

$$
[K_x, K_y] := K_x K_y - K_y K_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the generator of rotation in the xy plane.

Go anywhere with just five boosts

Given a rocket that can boost in any direction, but not rotate, you can
still make it rotate by Wigner rotation. If you must perform an
arbitrary Lorentz transformation, how many boosts do you need?

In general, if you have a Lorentz-transformed rocket, you can apply a
carefully aimed boost so that it comes to rest, then apply Wigner
rotation to return it back to the starting position.

With a cycle of three boosts, the Wigner rotation angle is equal to the
angle defect of the hyperbolic triangle, which can take any value in
(0,π) (you can’t have one with zero inner angle sum, but you can get
arbitrarily close). With a cycle of four boosts, we can cover the π case
as well, since a hyperbolic square can have any angle defect in (0,2π).

In summary: almost any Lorentz transformation can be obtained in four
boosts, except those requiring a 180-degree rotation, which need five
boosts.

In fact, the result can be improved by one boost: every Lorentz
transformation can be done in three boosts, except “180-degree screws”,
which require four. The solution given in
[@lightmanProblemBookRelativity1975, pp. 153--158] uses matrix algebra
in ℂ^(2 × 2), which is too algebraic for me[12]. However, I have never
found a satisfactory geometric method to demonstrate this, despite
thinking on and off about it several times over the years.

  Problem 1.28. What is the least number of pure boosts which generate
  an arbitrary Lorentz transformation? Note: This is a difficult
  problem! [@lightmanProblemBookRelativity1975]

[1] In jargon, it is isomorphic as a smooth manifold to ℝ^(n + 1), or
diffeomorphic to ℝ^(n + 1).

[2] The reason for calling it “rapidity”, instead of “velocity” would be
soon clear.

[3] Or as I like to say, 3-vectors are inherently violent in special
relativity, and anything involving anything inherently violent is also
inherently violent.

[4] The space of rotations in ℝ³ is SO(3) and that in ℝ² is SO(2). While
SO(2) is just the circle and can be easily represented by a real number
or an angle, SO(3) is the projective 3-space ℙℝ³ and best represented by
quaternions.

[5] Since this usage of “violence” comes directly from Hermann Weyl,
perhaps we can call it Weylence?

[6] This is not a handwaved proof, but fully rigorous. The Wigner
rotation of a full cycle is πv² + O(v⁴), and the area enclosed by the
cycle is also πv² + O(v⁴). Therefore, we can integrate over an arbitrary
area, to find that the Wigner rotation angle is equal to the area
enclosed, up to an infinitesimal term of O(v²) → 0.

[7] Indeed, there is no way to cover the space with parallel-transported
local frames, because the space is curved, and therefore if you try to
transport a local frame in a cycle back to its starting point, it would
have rotated against itself. To be a curved space is equivalent to have
no system of parallel-transported local frame, and curvature measures
the amount of rotation-against-itself that happens when you transport a
local frame in an infinitesimal circle.

[8] This is immediate from Archimedes’ hat-box theorem, which is the
basis of the Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection.

[9] You walk 1 km south, 1 km east, and 1 km north, and ended up at the
same point. You see a bear. Why is the bear white?

[10] Relative rotation means that we are measuring the orientation of
the vector relative to the local frame. However, since the frames
themselves are not parallel-transports of each other, relative rotation
is arbitrary and not a fact of geometry, but a fact of convenience. If
you move the vector back to its starting point, however, there is
absolutely no dispute about how much it has rotated, and it does not
depend on any system of local frames. You just have to compare the
vector against itself.

[11] To be precise, this is a sidereal day, the time it takes for the
Earth to rotate one cycle relative to distant stars. It is shorter than
a solar day.

[12]
  In these days the angel of topology and the devil of abstract algebra
  fight for the soul of each individual mathematical domain.
