      "* `/var`: Variable data. It is somewhat like `/run` in that both are meant to be read-written by programs, but unlike `/run`, data here persists over reboots. This is often used for logging information. For example, try `vim /var/log/user.log`\n",

      "### Quick reference\n",

      "The cron job syntax is as follows (See [Crontab.guru - The cron schedule expression editor]:\n",

      "Check that `cron` service is running by ` systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep \"cron\"`\n",

      "List cron jobs by `crontab -l`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Creating a Cron Job\n",
      "\n",
      "For this example, we create a job that runs every 20 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Open Crontab**: \n",
      "   Open your crontab file by typing `crontab -e` in your terminal. This command opens the crontab file for the current user in the default text editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Write Cron Job**: \n",
      "   Standard cron jobs can't run in a smaller granularity than a minute. For a once-per-20-seconds job, you'll need to use a workaround.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Add the following lines to your crontab:\n",
      "\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "   * * * * * /path/to/script.sh\n",
      "   * * * * * sleep 20; ~/cronjobs/script.sh\n",
      "   * * * * * sleep 40; ~/cronjobs/script.sh\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Script Content**: \n",
      "   Create `script.sh`, have the following content:\n",

      "  CRON_MESSAGE=\"Some message\"\n",

      "\n",
      "### Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Location**: Store scripts in a dedicated directory, such as `~/cronjobs`, for better organization.\n",
      "- **Script Naming**: Use meaningful names for your scripts for easier identification.\n",
      "- **Logging**: Implement logging within your scripts to capture output and errors for later review. It's good practice to use `/var/log/cron` for logging.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cron environment variables\n",
      "\n",
      "Cron jobs run in a minimal environment, so any environment variable, like `CRON_MESSAGE`, is not accessible by the cron script. Instead, you have a few choices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Put it directly in the crontab file:\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Put it directly in the script:\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If the variable is defined in an external file (like ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or a custom configuration file), you can source that file at the beginning of your script:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Troubleshooting\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Check Permissions**: Ensure your script is executable and the cron daemon has the necessary permissions to run it.\n",
      "- **Logs**: Check `/var/log/cron` or relevant logs for errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're using WSL, ensure that the cron service is running since it doesn't start by default. Use `sudo service cron start`. You can configure `~/.bashrc` by adding the following line: `sudo service cron start`, but it would make you enter the password at every login.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, enable `systemd` as described at @sec-init-vs-systemd.\n",
